Part 4: VECTOR STORE AND INDEXING 
Indexing Algorithms (Important for Interviews!)

Brute force = compare query to every vector = O(n) = too slow at scale
Solution: Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) algorithms

Algorithm                           How It Works                                                                    Tradeoff

Flat (brute force)                  Compare all vectors                                                             100% accurate, slowest
IVF (Inverted File)                 Cluster vectors, search only relevant clusters                                  Fast, needs training
HNSW (Hierarchical NSW)             Graph-based, navigate through layers                                            Very fast, more memory
PQ (Product Quantization)           Compress vectors                                                                Low memory, less accurate
IVF-PQ                              Combines IVF + PQ                                                               Balanced for large scale


"What is HNSW and how does it work?"
"What's the difference between IVF and HNSW?"
"How would you choose a vector database?"

"What's the tradeoff between accuracy and speed in ANN search?"
"How does filtering work with vector search?"
"What happens when your vectors don't fit in memory?"

"HNSW is a graph-based algorithm for approximate nearest neighbor search. 
It builds a multi-layer graph where the top layers have fewer nodes with long-range connections for fast navigation, 
and bottom layers have all nodes with local connections for precision. During search, 
you start at the top, greedily move toward the query vector, then drop down layers until you 
find the nearest neighbors. It's fast, has high recall, and is the most popular algorithm in production vector databases."
